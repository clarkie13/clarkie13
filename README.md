- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @clarkie13
- I am a physics graduate and a data analyst by trade.
- My main language is MatLab as it is the industry standard (at least in my field). I also have some knowledge and experience with Python from my uni days.
- The aim of joining GitHub is to learn C# by seeing how others write and hopefully in the future produce something worthwhile to share.
